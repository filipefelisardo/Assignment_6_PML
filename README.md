Assignment description

Adapt the Script that implements a convolutional neural network with PyTorch over the mnist 8 by 8 practice data set available on Overview notebook to classify images from the CIFAR-10 data set which contains 60000 32 by 32 color images. You need to access/download the data and you need to adjust the parameters in the model for the input and hidden layers. The CIFAR-10 images have 3 channels, H=32, and W=32. You are not supposed to use other pre-defined and pre-trained models as in many examples that you can find on-line but the model in the script. Getting a high accuracy is not a goal. The goal is to be able to adapt the code and explain in the video how you did it.
